trade76 data

- Does the  eewt variable have an effect on US exports to a country? US imports?

- Run the same models using the log of eewt. What happens to the sample size? Why?

log of 0 = infinity, is.finite restricts data to finite values

- Run the first two models on only GATT countries
- use these coefficents to predict the value of lnX and lnM for non-GATT countries

plot the actual non-GATT lnX and lnM with predicted values


-convert the eewt variable into a dichtomous variable 
-which countries have non-zero values of eewt?

- try to predict eewt using variables at hand
- create a European variable (ccode>=200 & ccode<400)
- is it significant
