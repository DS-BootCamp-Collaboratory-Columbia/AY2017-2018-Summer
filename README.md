## Data Science for Social Scientists

### The Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy (ISERP) and the Data Science Institute are jointly organizing a two-week workshop on data science for social scientists
- **When**: May 21st - June 1st, 2018
- **Where**: IAB 270B
- **Daily schedule**: 9am to 4pm (9am to 1pm consists of a lecture + lunch talk and 1pm to 4pm is a lab session) 
- **Who should apply**: Faculty and researchers in the social sciences and SIPA interested in learning more about  science.

While many social scientists use quantitative data, the increasing volume of digitized and “born digital” collections of books, articles, documents, and social media present tremendous new opportunities for research. But for those with little training in computer science, the barriers to entry can seem daunting. 

[Columbia’s Working Group on Computational Social Science](http://css.iserp.columbia.edu/) is therefore offering a new workshop to offer a very practical introduction to computer packages accessible to researchers with varying skill sets. Participants will learn how to organize and analyze textual data, get an overview of advances in natural language processing and machine learning, see how they can grapple with old research problems with new rigor, and take on entirely new kinds of questions.

**[Raymond Hicks](http://www.columbia.edu/~rh2883/)** ([@amueller](https://github.com/amueller)) is project manager at [History Lab](http://history-lab.org/) at Columbia University. Before coming to Columbia, he was statistical programmer for the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University. His research interests include the politics of trade and monetary policy as well as methodology. His work has appeared in *The Journal of Politics*, *the British Journal of Political Science*, *International Organization*, and *International Studies Quarterly*, among other journals. His current projects use textual data to explore questions about trade policy.

**[Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/)** ([@tz33cu](https://github.com/tz33cu)) is Professor of Statistics, Associate Director for Education of Data Science Institute at Columbia University. She develops novel methods for exploring and understanding patterns in complex data from different application domains such as biology, psychology, climatology, and etc. Her current projects are in the fields of statistical machine learning, spatiotemporal modeling and social network analysis. Professor Zheng’s research has been recognized by the 2008 Outstanding Statistical Application Award from the American Statistical Association (ASA), the Mitchell Prize from ISBA and a Google research award. She became a Fellow of American Statistical Association in 2014. Professor Zheng is the receipt of 2017 Columbia’s Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching. In 2018, she will be the chair-elect for ASA’s section on Statistical Learning and Data Science. She is on the advisory board for STATS at Sense About Science America that targets to develop a statistical literate citizenry.
