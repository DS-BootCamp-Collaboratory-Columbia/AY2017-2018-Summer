## Summer 2017-2018 Data Science for Social Scientists

- When: May 21st - June 1st, 2018
- Where: IAB 270B
- Daily schedule: 9am to 4pm

### Course Information
The course is a blend of online learning experiences (about 2 hours of preparation will be required per day), in-class lectures, hands-on laboratory exercises with a variety of data sets, and a capstone project. The course will use the Python programming language. Participants are required to bring their own computer to the daily sessions. Lunch and refreshments are **NOT** provided.
